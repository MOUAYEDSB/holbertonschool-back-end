# Description ðŸ’¬
An API (which stands for "Application Programming Interface") is like a special set of instructions that the robot understands. It's like a magical booklet that tells you exactly how to make the robot do different actions. You don't need to know how the robot's insides work; you just need to follow the instructions in the booklet.
